src/main ---> This is used to write the generic utilities of the framework
src/test ---> This is where we write the actual test cases or do the actual coding
pom.xml ----> Heart of any maven project because it can manage external libraries and it can help us execute the code in our absence
src/main/java ---> It consists of only coding related files
src/test/java
src/test/resources ---> It Consists of non coding related files src/main/resources
--------------------------------------------------------
First is that we need to create a package under src/main/java
or src/main/resources or any src/test/
When we give a package name, always the first letter should be a small letter
We need to follow camel case
Ex: durgeshMishra
When we give a class name, always the first letter should be a capital letter
We need to follow pascal case syntax
Ex: AdityaKumar
/Prints the data onto the console System.out.println("Hello World");
//Shortcut for writing System.out.println()
//type sout followed by enter key System.out.println("This is my first program");

BODMAS rule need to be followed-

        //ASCII Ranges:
        //A - Z = 65-90
        //a - z = 97-122
        //0- 9  = 48-57
        // =32
