What is an Interface??

Interface is similar to class, which does not have any implementation.
It is a way to achieve 100 percent abstraction in Java.
It is a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
It is a way to achieve loose coupling in Java. --> Loose coupling is a design pattern which promotes a system where each of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components.

Each and every method in Interface is public by default.
Each and every variable in Interface is public, static and final by default.

From JAVA 8 onwards, we can have default and static methods in Interface, but they do not be a part of the abstract methods count.

In Layman Interface serves as a contract between the class and the outside world.
If a class implements an interface, it is bound to provide the implementation of all the methods declared in the interface

Different Types of Interfaces:
1. Functional Interface --> We can have only one abstract method. 80% of JAVA works on abstract methods
2. Normal Interface
3. Marker Interface --> Replaced with Annotations
